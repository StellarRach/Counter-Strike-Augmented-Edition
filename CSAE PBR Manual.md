# _CSAE_ Physically Based Rendering (_PBR_) Manual

[_PBR_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering) is a rendering technique that many modern game engines utilizes. 
_CSAE_ introduced this method to improve the rendering quality of _AWM_.

Note that _CSAE_ hasn't introduced other graphics techniques yet. Thus you should only expect some special effects from _PBR_, not the whole video quality.

**Before you get started, make sure that your GPU is capable of _PBR_. See the release notes of [Build 1500](https://github.com/ltndkl/Counter-Strike-Augmented-Edition/releases/tag/1500).**

**⚠️This manual will be finished in the coming days.**
